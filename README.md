# shelter

In this project I build adaptive website. That was useful to improve skills below:
  - first of all I used **Sass** preprocessor;
  - since its adaptive layout I used flexbox and grid actively;
  - add, remove and toggling classLists;
  - grabbing DOM elements;
  - different kind of anchor tags eg. email, tel, map;
  - media queries for ultimate layouts;
  - transitions, transforms, hovering elements etc;
  - i used **Perfect Pixel** for exact matching design;
